        </li>
        <li>
            The site incorporates a form element on the advice page. The form is used to gather the name email and comment from the user in order for it to be in an email to the client

            The site includes links to other sites on the main page under Favorite stores and on the must haves page

            There are five pages: home, advice, blog, feed, and must haves

        <li>
            The fav icon is of a shoe as this site is mostly about fashion 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is an animation on the advice page. When the user presses send the word sending moves actoss the screen until the form reappears

            This is my report of how I met the requirements of the project found under report.html
        </li>
        <li>
            The images are all appropriate to the theme for they have to do with the client 
        </li>
        <li>
            The images are sized to appear appropriately on any screen type
        </li>
        <li>
            The basic style of the pages is a header on the top with an asside on the right for most pages and an aside on both sides for the home page
        </li>
        <li>
            The site includes different fonts for the heaers and the text to be read 
        </li>
        <li>
            The client was in mind throughout the entire process of making this site. We communicated on every detail which was being added 
        </li>
        <li>
            The site moves from multiple columns to a single column layout on smaller screens 
        </li>
        <li>
            It is very easy to naviagte the site using the navigation bar located right below the header 
        </li>
        <li>
            All images have alt attributes that tell a little bit about the image

            Classes and ids as well as selectors are used appropriately
        </li>
        <li>
            All filenames are lowercase
        </li>
        <li>
            The site is served over HTTPS on port 443 and port 80 redirects to port 443

            The HTML and CSS pass all validation
        </li>
        <li>
