                    I took a weekend trip to Newport, Rhode Island this weekend. What a BEAUTIFUL place. We stayed at Castle Hill Inn, in a Harbor front cottage. The service, the food, the view was fantastic. It is a very quaint mansion about 12 minutes from the center of town of Newport.

                    We ate dinner the first night at The Lawn, at Castle Hill Inn. I think I ate the best Lobster Roll I ever had!!!

                    The next morning we went to Cliff Walk, which is definitely a MUST. It provides great views of the mansions and the ocean, while getting some exercise.  We took a tour of the Breakers, one of the Vanderbilt Mansions, which is also a MUST see. I recommend using the app, which is like a private tour guide and you can move at your own pace.

                    We then went to town to have lunch and shop around. We ate roof-top at the Oyster Bar which was very conveniently located in town. Food was very fresh and delicious.

                    We had dinner at Thames Street Kitchen one night and the last night at the Black Pearl. Both I highly recommend.

                    The Castle Hill Inn served tea and treats everyday between 3pm-5pm. It was such a special treat. The sunsets were spectacular and breathtaking.
