                    I took a weekend trip to Newport, Rhode Island this weekend. What a BEAUTIFUL place. We stayed at Castle Hill Inn, in a Harbor front cottage. The service, the food, the view was fantastic. It is a very quaint mansion about 12 minutes from the center of town of Newport.

                <p>
                    We ate dinner the first night at The Lawn, at Castle Hill Inn. I think I ate the best Lobster Roll I ever had!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next morning we went to Cliff Walk, which is definitely a MUST. It provides great views of the mansions and the ocean, while getting some exercise.  We took a tour of the Breakers, one of the Vanderbilt Mansions, which is also a MUST see. I recommend using the app, which is like a private tour guide and you can move at your own pace.

                    We then went to town to have lunch and shop around. We ate roof-top at the Oyster Bar which was very conveniently located in town. Food was very fresh and delicious.

                <p>
                    We had dinner at Thames Street Kitchen one night and the last night at the Black Pearl. Both I highly recommend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Castle Hill Inn served tea and treats everyday between 3pm-5pm. It was such a special treat. The sunsets were spectacular and breathtaking.

                    Great place to visit!! Please contact me with any questions regarding your itinerary or I can help you pack too :)

                <p>The DYSON AIR WRAP is definitely one of my favorite things.
                    My hair has always been an issue for me to style on my own. I have a hard time blow drying my hair with 2 hands. 
                    The Dyson Air Wrap  has made it so easy. It comes with several different attachments in its own leather case.</p>
                    <p>The basic dryer attachment, is what I use first. It really cuts the drying/styling time in half.
                        I dry my hair about 80%. I then use the LARGE curl barrels. You need to switch to do the other side. I then use the SMALL barrels to do the hair again, but very quickly. It takes about 15 minutes top to dry and style my hair.</p>
                    <p>If I want more hold in my curls, I also use the BEACH WAVER, 1in barrel. It comes in a few other sizes, but the 1in works best for my hair.</p>
                    <p>hair right before I blow it dry. 
                        I just started using RITA HAZAN CREAM…I am loving it!!! Great addition to the HAIR PRODUCTS :)</p>
                    <p>Please feel free to ask any questions about my hair regime…</p>

                <p>The scent of my home is very important to me. I absolutely love candles. I must set a timer to remind myself sometimes to blow them out. However, I still light candles…:)</p>
                <p>One of my favorite smells is VOLCANO. It is made by Capri Blu.
                    You can find this at Nordstrom or Anthropologie. </p>
                <p>I also like the smell TAHITI , it is made by BOHEME. It smells so pretty. It makes the whole house smell GREAT!!!
                    These are SOY based candles.</p>
